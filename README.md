#####Release repository for The Skeleton Test Suite.

## Introduction

Herein lies a tool for the automated generation of digital objects based on the digital signatures documented in the PRONOM database maintained by The National Archives, UK: PRONOM Data is licensed under the Open Government Licence (OGL): http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/

The skeleton-test-suite-generator serves to fill the gap that exists whereby the community requires a corpus of digital objects for the validation and evaluation of format identification tools and techniques. The tool should be used to complement a methodology whereby skeleton files are also generated manually by signature developers.

The research paper this work led to can be found here: http://www.ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/view/8.1.120

###Testing reports

I completed two reports on the Skeleton Test Suite back in 2012/2013. They document testing of the files on DROID and explore reasons why some files do or do not work. The reports and links to the test-suites used for testing can be found on the repo wiki, here: https://github.com/exponential-decay/skeleton-test-suite-generator/wiki
